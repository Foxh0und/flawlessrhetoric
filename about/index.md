Hello, I'm Adam, a software developer based in Melbourne, Australia. 
I work at Atlassian, specialising in backend development using Java and AWS.
Iâ€™m currently enjoying learning Rust and GoLang. 
I have a passion for all things computing, particularly open source software development. 
Outside of computer science, I enjoy travelling, literature, motor mechanics, and I am an avid Chelsea FC supporter.
