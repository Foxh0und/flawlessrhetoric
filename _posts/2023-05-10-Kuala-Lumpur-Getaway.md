## Introduction 
Much like my spain post, I'm a little bit late to writing this. With Mikaela living in Cambodia, KL provided a great location for us to meet, if only for a weekend. I was pleasently surprised by the city, and really enjoyed it, wouldn't hesitate to go back.

[Feeka Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/feekacoffeeroasters/?hl=en) - a great little coffee shop we found that served many different types of coffee including great cold brew, and a fantistic food menu. We went twice, and would definitely go back if in KL

Batu Caves, one of the most popular attractions in the whole of Malaysia, the stairs were quite a challenge.

Heli Lounge Bar - quite literally on a helipad. I wouldn't go if you're afraid of hights, which were dizzying. Provided a fantastic view of the city.

[Lit Books](https://litbooks.com.my/about-us/) - an independent bookstore run by two former journalists, who were very accomodating when we went there, providing great suggestions. They had many books predominantly by Malysian authors in english. It was a 20 minute taxi ride from the centre of town, but well worth the trip. Also had a nice coffee bar.

I hadn't been to KL before, but I really enjoyed it, plenty of good food and drink, and plenty to do. It was perfect for an extended weekend away.
