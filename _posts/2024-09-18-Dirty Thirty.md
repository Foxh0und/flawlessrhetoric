## Introduction 
Unfortunately, I am getting into the bad habit of doing these over 6 months late. That stops now (hopefully).

For my 30th birthday, I traveled to Tokyo with Mikaela for 10 days in the first week of December to celebrate and enjoy a really great city, where a couple of friends live, and another was also traveling. This was my second time to Japan after heading there with Ryan C who now lives there when we went for a month in 2016 together. Japan has always been a country I've enjoyed traveling to a lot, and would love to go back again.

The Nissan Centre in Ginza. This had some fantastic cars, both new and old, as well as being able to get a coffee with the car of your choice printed on top.

Tokyo Tower, not the tallest building in Tokyo, but in my mind the best. Great to look at from a distance, but also to spend time in and climb.

Neither of us are big fans of look outs, but Shibuya Sky was definitely worth it, the view was great, and if you look closely you can see Mt. Fuji in the distance

Even from the lower levels, you can see the whole city.

Good to see this sign is still there in the British Hub 7 years later

Last time I came I didn't go to Asaksa, and am not sure why, but I really really enjoyed it, the long market was very scenic, as were the temples.

On my birthday, Ryan took me out to Kawagoe, a beautiful town just outside of Tokyo

And then on my final day, we went driving around his home area of Saitama, which was fantastic with some awesome lookouts

On my birthday in Kawagoe, it was fantastic to go out to a great Yakitori restaurant and to spend it with my friends overseas
