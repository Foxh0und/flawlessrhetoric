Australia is in the middle of a bushfire crisis, with a state of emergency declared for seven days just after the new year in NSW, the worst hit state [1].
However, the secondary affects of the fires is also a large cause for concern, with the air quality dropping to the worst possible level this morning (14/01/2020) [2].

The one question on my mind, was how does it compare to cities commonly thought of as having poor air quality?
Using canva, and data retrivied from [AQICN](aqicn.org), I was able to get real time statistics and plot the data.
