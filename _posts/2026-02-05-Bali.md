## Introduction 
In July last year as winter bit into Melbourne, my family and I went to a resort in Bali. It was my first time to the Island (I'd been to Jakarta in 2016 on a study tour). We were in an all inclusive resort, and didn't really get the Bali experience. It could have been anywhere in the world. We didn't leave besides going to a local shopping centre that was about a 20 minute walk away, and unfortunately the hospital as I ended up really unwell. Overall a great trip and I look forward to doing another family holiday soon.

Spending two nights in hospital wasn't ideal, but the level of care was great
