## Introduction 
Much like my last two posts, I'm a little bit late to the party in writing this. In April 2023, Mikaela and I spent two and a half weeks travelling through Vietnam, following the HCM method of coming from the north to south. We met up in Hanoi, with a small trip to Ha Long Bay, then to Ninh Binh, into Hoi An via Danag, and finally finished up in Saigon. 

## Hanoi
We stayed in the bustling old quarter of hanoi, it was a great spot to be to venture out in many directions.

## Ha Long Bay
Not far from Hanoi is the famed Ha Long Bay, where we went on an overnight trip through, which was just spectacular

## Ninh Binh
After a full week or so in Hanoi and Ha Long Bay, we got in a shuttle bus and headed south into the country side to Ninh Binh, a small but lively town with much to offer.

Scooter is the main and best way to get around Ninh Binh

Was just lovely watching us drop points at home to Brighton.

## Hoi An
From Ninh Binh, we got an overnight train to Da Nang and a taxi to the seaside town of Hoi An, which was just wonderful.

The trains were almost identical to the Trans Siberian Express

Despite the humidity, it was a fantastic town to cycle around in

The river with all the laterns is beautiful, this photo does it no justice

It was lovely to celebrate Mikaea's birthday at Morning Glory, a resturant I recommend to anyone


## Saigon
After finishing in Hoi An, we caught a rather early taxi back to Da Nang and a short flight to the capital, Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). We stayed in District 1 which provided easy access to everything we wanted to see. I really loved the city and it was possibly the highlight of the trip for me.

It was a fantastic trip, I loved every part of it, and it was one of the first holidays I was really looking forward to the food, which lived up to the expectations. I would have loved to have gone to more destinations, such as Hue, and can see myself going back to Vietnam in the near future.
