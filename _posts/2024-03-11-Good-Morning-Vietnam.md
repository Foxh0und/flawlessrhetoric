## Introduction 
Much like my last two posts, I'm a little bit late to the party in writing this. In April 2023, Mikaela and I spent two and a half weeks travelling through Vietnam, following the HCM method of coming from the north to south. We met up in Hanoi, with a small trip to Ha Long Bay, then to Ninh Binh, into Hoi An via Danag, and finally finished up in Saigon. 

## Hanoi
We stayed in the bustling old quarter of hanoi, it was a great spot to be to venture out in many directions.

## Ha Long Bay
Not far from Hanoi is the famed Ha Long Bay, where we went on an overnight trip through, which was just spectacular

## Ninh Binh
After a full week or so in Hanoi and Ha Long Bay, we got in a shuttle bus and headed south into the country side to Ninh Binh, a small but lively town with much to offer.

Was just lovely watching us drop points at home to Brighton.

## Hoi An
From Ninh Binh, we got an overnight train to Da Nang and a taxi to the seaside town of Hoi An, which was just wonderful.

The trains were almost identical to the Trans Siberian Express

Despite the humidity, it was a fantastic town to cycle around in

It was lovely to celebrate Mikaea's birthday at Morning Glory, a resturant I recommend to anyone


## Saigon
After finishing in Hoi An, we caught a rather early taxi back to Da Nang and a short flight to the capital, Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). We stayed in District 1 which provided easy access to everything we wanted to see. I really loved the city and it was possibly the highlight of the trip for me.

It was a fantastic trip, I loved every part of it, and it was one of the first holidays I was really looking forward to the food, which lived up to the expectations. I would have loved to have gone to more destinations, such as Hue, and can see myself going back to Vietnam in the near future.
