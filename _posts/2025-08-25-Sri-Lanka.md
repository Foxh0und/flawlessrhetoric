## Introduction 
Continuing on, only a year late, but here is my Sri Lanka post! Last year in August we traveled to Sri Lanka for two and a half weeks, traversing a lot of the island. We saw lots of fantastic sights, ate lots of great food, and overall had a great time!


## Colombo

Our first stop was the capital, Colombo, we didn't stay here too long, only a couple of nights, but we enjoyed it for what it was. We went to the famous Ministry of Crab resturant, highly recommend.

## Kandy

We then caught the train to Kandy, which was nice, as a base for the next few days. I didn't enjoy Kandy as much as others seem to, but it is worth going, especially for the surrounding areas.

My favourite part of Kandy was the Royal Botanical Gardens


### Sigiriya and Dambulla

We took a day trip out to see one of the most famous sights on the island Sigiriya, and the nearby Dambulla.

It was a hike and a half, but the view was phenomenal.

## Haputale

After leaving Kandy, we ventured towards Haputale in the mountains via train, and this was the highlight of the trip for me.

We then did a sunrise hike from Lipton Seat back into town, well above the clouds, it was beautiful.

## Tissamaharama 
We then ventured down by car further south and closer to sea level to Tissamaharama, primarily to go on an amazing Safari. On the way here from Ella, we also stopped at the largest waterfall in the country, where you can go swimming in the pools at the top.

## Hiriketiya
Then we went to Hiriketiya, by the beach, where it was really nice and relaxed, we ate some of the best food and had a really nice time.

## Galle
For our final night, and on our way back up to Colombo, we stopped at the old fort town of Galle, with lots of old buildings. Funnily enough, I also ran into an old work colleague Amir and his family in a local restaurant.

It provided stunning views over the Pacific.

### Conclusion
It was a really fantastic trip, I learnt lots about Sri Lanka through experiencing it, and many of the books I read whilst there.
