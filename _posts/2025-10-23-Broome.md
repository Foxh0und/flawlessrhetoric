## Introduction 
Over last New Year (2024-2025), Mikaela and I went to Broome for a week. I've always wanted to go, flights were cheap, it was their off season. Despite this not being the best time of year to attend, we really enjoyed it. 
It didn't rain as much as the forecast threatened thankfully, although it did get very, very hot. We ate some great food and had a really relaxing week.

Dusk was the best time on the beach

Out on the other side, the colours were spectacular

A lot of rockpools are around, with a lot of fish

The oldest operating outdoor cinema in the world, we saw Paddington 3 here, one of the better movie experiences we've been too. It was also really cool to see in town the influence the Japanese migrants had from the early days of the town.
